      <h3>This website is purely functional.  Unlike its creator, it will not win any beauty contests :) </h3>
      <h3>But what it lacks in prettiness, it makes up for a Django-ness.</h3>
      <h3>Visitors to the site can register profiles to become Users.  Once registered, users can log in/out, and create/rate items.
      Guests can also look through reviews, although they cannot create/rate anything.  Once logged in, mutliple new functions for
      creating and rating items will be made available.  To prevent alcoholism, only 1 item can be created per user, per day.
      Additionally, users can only review each beer once.  Duplicate beer names are not allowed.
      Each user can reference the items created by him/herself by clicking on the "@username" link in the upper right corner of the
      screen (this link becomes active once a user has registered and logged in successfully).</h3>

      <h3>The links on the Beer list below are all functional, and can be used to access details for the corresponding fields.
      Each beer listing contains a user link, displaying all beers/ratings created by that user.
      If a beer has been rated by any user, that beer listing entry also has an average score link which will show
      the details of each individual score.</h3>
